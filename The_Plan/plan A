1. World Generation:
Map Creation: Use algorithms like Perlin noise or cellular automata to generate a natural-looking 2D world with terrain features (e.g., mountains, forests, rivers).
Resource Placement: Distribute resources based on terrain type to influence civilization development.
2. Civilization Placement:
Initial Placement: Place civilizations strategically on the map based on access to resources and desirable land.
Attributes Assignment: Assign unique traits to each civilization (e.g., resourcefulness, aggressiveness, cultural focus).
3. Progression Through Ages:
Age Progression Logic: Create a system that simulates different technological and cultural eras (e.g., Stone Age, Bronze Age, Renaissance).
Decision-Making AI: Implement rules for how civilizations advance based on available resources, neighboring civs, and internal growth.
4. Artifact Generation:
NLP Integration: Use language models trained on cultural texts to simulate written works or legends that evolve as civilizations advance.
Procedural Art/Tools Creation: Design algorithms that generate art or functional artifacts reflecting the current age and the civilizationâ€™s unique traits.
Dynamic Updates: Ensure artifacts change in complexity and style as civilizations progress through different ages.
5. Simulation Loop:
Create an event-driven loop that continuously updates the world state, civ status, and artifact generation over simulated time.
6. Evaluation and Visualization:
Metrics: Track cultural diversity, artifact uniqueness, and progression rates to assess the realism and depth of the simulation.
Visualization Tools: Use libraries (e.g., p5.js or Three.js) for displaying the 2D map, civilizations, and artifacts in an engaging way
