# Cultura
Cultura leverages NLP and procedural generation to create cultural artifacts that reflect the evolution and diversity of civilizations. Using historical and linguistic data, Cultura generates texts that embody cultural shifts over time. The project explores how computational models can simulate nuanced cultural identities.
